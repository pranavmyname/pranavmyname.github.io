## [Tensorflow Test Time Augmentation (tensorflow-tta)](https://github.com/pranavmyname/tensorflow_tta)

Tensorflow Test Time Augmentation: Test time augmentation on Tensorflow keras models which utilizes GPU acceleration for segmentation models. It helps in improving accuracy of the model over the test dataset

## [Change Detection with Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/pranavmyname/dw-analytics)
This repo contains filtering modules for dynamic world data available on google earth engine. The filtering functions have been written to aid in time-series analysis and solve problems such as poor predictions due to cloudy or unforseen weather conditions through the utilisation previous trust-worthy values. It can also be used for the Sentinel-2 data catalogue. It also contains example codes on change detection post filtering the data with the modules available in this repo. The data thus generated can be visualized with a flask application that can be run with the main.py file in the app folder.
