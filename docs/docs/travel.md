# Memorable destinations


## Maldives

Maafushi Island in the Maldives offered a completely different world away from the hustle and bustle of big cities. It offered a unique experience in between the diverse marine life. During our visit, we explored the corals, encountered turtles, and even swam with sharks.

## France
France had a lot to offer for everyone. The city of Lyon had beautiful cathedrals and beautiful landscapes; Annecy was a lucky find which had beautiful lakes, mountains and lovely weather which was both peaceful and happenning; Nice had blue water beaches with amazing restaurants and food. Paris was one place that we found overhyped and was a passable experience for me.
